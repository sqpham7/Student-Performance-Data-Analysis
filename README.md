Background and Purpose:
The data analysis project uses data from 1000 students across various demographic groups and academic backgrounds.
The dataset includes information such as age, gender, year in school, major, monthly income, financial aid received, and expenses in different spending categories.
Spending categories include tuition, housing, food, transportation, books & supplies, entertainment, personal care, technology, health & wellness, and miscellaneous expenses.

The Purpose of this analysis is to analyze student spending habits to determine levels of financial literacy and to determine what factors may influence their financial health and budgeting strategies. Through key demographic and statistical metrics, this analysis can assist financial planners, lending institutions and loan officers to better assess the needs and risk of student borrowers.
