As Project Manager, I led a team in analyzing student academic performance through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and machine learning (Random Forests, Decision Trees). We identified key factors such as study hours, attendance, and tutoring sessions that strongly influence exam scores. We presented our findings and recommendations to the Executive Board of the Blue Hen Data Analytics Club.

The objective of this project was to identify how factors such as study habits, extracurricular commitments, attendance, and time allocation influence outcomes, with the broader goal of enhancing educational strategies and supporting student success. Our analysis focused on solving the real-world challenge of time management, offering insights that can help educators, administrators, and students make more informed decisions. This work has practical applications in schools and universities, with use cases such as predicting academic success and providing tailored strategies for improvement.

Using Python and Tableau, we cleaned and analyzed a structured dataset (sourced from Kaggle) through predictive modeling techniques including decision trees and random forests. The methodology included careful preprocessing, validation, and a detailed project plan to ensure the analysis was both robust and replicable. The expected outcome was a clear identification of which attributes most strongly influence exam performance, as well as actionable time management strategies. 

Results were presented to the Executive Board of the Blue Hen Data Analytics Club in the form of visualizations and a PowerPoint presentation, with recommendations designed to help students improve their academic outcomes through better study habits, attendance, and resource utilization.
