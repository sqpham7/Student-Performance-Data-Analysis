Background and Purpose:
The data analysis project uses data from 1000 students across various demographic groups and academic backgrounds.
The dataset includes information such as age, gender, year in school, major, monthly income, financial aid received, and expenses in different spending categories.
Spending categories include tuition, housing, food, transportation, books & supplies, entertainment, personal care, technology, health & wellness, and miscellaneous expenses.

The Purpose of this analysis is to analyze student spending habits to determine levels of financial literacy and to determine what factors may influence their financial health and budgeting strategies. Through key demographic and statistical metrics, this analysis can assist financial planners, lending institutions and loan officers to better assess the needs and risk of student borrowers.



This project aims to identify the key attributes that correlate with high academic performance, particularly in terms of exam scores.

Objective/Purpose:
- What is the main goal of the analysis?
  By analyzing various factors, we hope to uncover insights that can enhance
educational strategies and support student success.
- What business or real-world problem are you trying to solve?
  Time management
- How would the results of this analysis impact decision-making?
The result of this analysis will provide insights for educators, administrators, and students. By identifying effective time management strategies and other correlating attributes, decision-makers can develop targeted strategies and resources.
Context and Situation:
-In what industry, business setting, or organization would this analysis be useful?
  Schools & Universities
- What is the potential use case for this analysis? (e.g., predicting customer churn, forecasting sales, optimizing inventory)
Predicting academic success.
- How will the insights from this analysis help solve a real-world problem?
By pinpointing the specific factors that correlate with high academic performance—such
as study habits, extracurricular commitments, or time allocation—educators and students can focus on what truly matters.

Tools and Techniques:
- What tools or software (Excel, R, Python, etc.) will you use to complete the analysis?
  Python and Tableau.
- What type of data will you use, and where will it come from?
  Student Performance factors dataset from Kaggle.
- Which machine learning or statistical techniques will you use? (e.g. predictive modeling, regression analysis)
  Predictive modeling
    
Data and Methodology:
- What type of dataset are you using? (Include details like size, type, and source) - Structured dataset; csv, 642 kb, excel file.
- How will you preprocess or clean the data to ensure high-quality results? -Ensuring correct data type, converting data types as needed.
- What steps will you take to ensure the analysis is robust and replicable?
- Creating a detailed project plan outlining objectives, methodologies, and
timelines.
Expected Outcome:
- What are the expected results or insights?
- Clear identification of which attributes significantly correlates with high academic
performance. Specific time management techniques that are linked to better
academic outcomes.
- How will these results be presented? (e.g. visualizations, powerpoint, dashboard)
Powerpoint with visualizations.
- How will the results be beneficial for the end user? (e.g. stakeholders, customers,
organization)
- Students will benefit from tailored recommendations and resources that help them
improve their time management and study skills, leading to better academic performance.
